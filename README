# Now available on both savannah and github

# Project:
	GraVitoN: A Cross Platform Malware Development Framework

# Version Info:
	2.0.0.-1

# Code Name:
	Scream of Pain

# Some Key Notes:
    0- Use doxygen to generate documentation. (There is a Doxyfile inside graviton/ folder)
	1- Always build external libraries statically
	2- Before using a class or function from GraVitoN lib, make sure that you now it's dependencies.
		(e.g. SSL_Client depends on openssl so you should link openssl's 
		static library (.a or .lib) to your project. of course you can refuse to do
		that and shuff-every-undefined-reference-error-up-to-your-ass!
		using dynamically linked libraries of code/external/ is lame,
		don't do it man!)
	99- There are rules to be broken.
