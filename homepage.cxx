 * \section about About
 *
 * ...the graviton is a hypothetical elementary particle that mediates the force of gravitation in the framework of quantum field theory.
 * If it exists, the graviton is expected to be mass-less...
 * graviton may actually be a "closed string",
 * which gives it the power to move to and from universes...

 * The purpose of 'graviton' is to become a platform, a beautiful combination of simple and smart ideas.
 * The purpose of 'graviton' is to become an artificial creature which can move between world of windows, world of apples, and world of emperor penguins, etc. and remain stealth! We believe as this project grows, security professionals will have a better and deeper understanding of how viruses, trojans, etc work, so they can fight and protect themselves against those, and they can even create 'white viruses', to spread and fight against malicious viruses, effectively. Currently the main idea of 'graviton' is this simple but powerful idea:
 * "Write a code which can exploit itself, so you can evade any antivirus."
 * 'graviton' is a combination of pure 'C++' and 'asm' and 'lua'.
 * 'graviton' asks to be compiled by 'gcc'!
 * GraVitoN has this parts: payloads, concealer, intercross, ai
 * With graver you can compile and customize your graviton as virus, trojan or even worm.
 * graviton project is hosted at

 * \section history History
 *
 * I was exploiting ms08-67 vulnerability on a windows box machine protected by Kaspersky AV, during a pentest.
 * exploit was lunched and meterpereter shell arrived. Kaspersky do nothing and victim's machine was mine, and Bang...
 * What if we write a devilish code which exploits itself?!
 * I tell this idea to Farhad (my friend) and we start to research about that.
 * finally I wrote our first code in C and compiled it with gcc, we run it, shell openned, and A.V was not suspicious to the file!
 * So what was our main idea?
 *
 * \subsection graver GraVer
 *
 * GraVer is a program that helps you to personalize and generate GraVitoN source code faster.
 *
 * \subsection develop Development
 *
 * GraVitoN will become a framework for designing viruses, trojans, worms, etc.
 * so it need a hard work, and 24/7 programming. If you have, free times and your care about malwaares[!],
 * you can spend your extra times developing GraVitoN!
 * you can register @ savannah and send us a membership request.
